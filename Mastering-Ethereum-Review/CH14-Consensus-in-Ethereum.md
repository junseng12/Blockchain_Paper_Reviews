# **📌 CH14: Ethereum's Consensus**

The Ethereum blockchain must maintain decentralization while ensuring that **all participants in the network maintain a single, agreed-upon state**.
The method used to achieve this is the **consensus algorithm**, and Ethereum aims to transition from the existing **Proof of Work (PoW)** method to the **Proof of Stake (PoS)** method.

## **📌 1️⃣ What is consensus?**

### **🔹 The concept of consensus**

- **What is consensus?**
  → **Multiple participants in a distributed system agree on a single “truth.”**
  → **The core of blockchain is that network participants maintain the same state without a centralized authority!**
- **Role of consensus algorithms**
- Ensure that the network **maintains the same blockchain records**
- **Prevents attacks or manipulation** and ensures reliability
  - **Decentralization and security** are solved simultaneously with this core technology
    📌 **Analogy:**
    > Consensus algorithms are similar to **“a process in which people who speak different languages agree on a common language.”**
    >
    > If participants do not follow **the same rules**, the network will be divided.

## **📌 2️⃣ Ethereum's consensus algorithm**

Ethereum currently uses **PoW (Proof of Work)**, but is gradually transitioning to **PoS (Proof of Stake)**.
| **Algorithm** | **Features** |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **PoW (Proof of Work)** | Generates blocks through computational work (mining), competition-based |
| **PoS (Proof of Stake)** | Validators who stake a certain amount of tokens generate blocks |
| **Casper (Ethereum PoS version)** | Protocol for transitioning Ethereum to PoS |

## **📌 3️⃣ PoW (Proof of Work)**

### **🔹 PoW Concept**

- A method of **generating blocks by utilizing the computational power of computers**
- Through a process called “mining,” **nodes that solve computational difficulties add blocks**
- **The longest chain (the chain with the most computational power invested) is recognized as the valid chain**
  📌 **Analogy:**
  > Blockchain is like a math test.
  >
  > The first person to get the correct answer can add a block and receive a reward.

### **🔹 Core elements of PoW**

1️⃣ **Mining**: Solving complex computational problems (hash puzzles) to generate blocks
2️⃣ **Computational Difficulty**: Adjusting the difficulty level at regular intervals to maintain the block generation speed
3️⃣ **Reward**: Miners who successfully generate a block receive newly issued ETH and transaction fees as rewards

### **🔹 Problems with PoW**

- **Massive energy consumption** (inefficient)
- **Risk of centralization by ASICs (specialized mining devices)**
- **Scalability issues** (transaction speed limitations)
  📌 **Analogy:**
  > PoW is a competition to see who can solve a difficult problem first.
  >
  > Those with faster computers (ASICs) have an advantage, posing the risk of monopolization by a few large miners.

## **📌 4️⃣ PoS (Proof of Stake)**

### **🔹 PoS Concept**

- **A method of creating blocks without mining (computational work)**
- Users who stake a certain amount of coins (staking) have the **right to generate blocks**
- **The more coins you stake, the higher the probability of generating blocks**
  📌 **Analogy:**
  > PoS is similar to a **bank deposit interest system**.
  >
  > Just as the more money you deposit, the higher the probability of receiving interest, **the more ETH you stake, the greater the block creation authority**.

### **🔹 Key elements of PoS**

1️⃣ **Validator**: Users who stake ETH participate as validators
2️⃣ **Reward**: Validators receive a small amount of ETH as a reward for creating a block
3️⃣ **Penalty (Slashing)**: If a validator commits a violation, a portion of the staked ETH is confiscated

### **🔹 Advantages of PoS**

✅ **Reduced power consumption** (no mining required)
✅ **Higher scalability** (faster block creation possible)
✅ **Improved decentralization** (reduced influence of mining equipment)
📌 **Analogy:**

> PoS is similar to **“paying bank interest.”**
>
> Block creation is determined by the amount of money deposited (staked), not mining.

## **📌 5️⃣ Casper: Ethereum's PoS model**

### **🔹 What is Casper?**

Casper is Ethereum's PoS model, which introduces the concept of **“slashing”**, distinguishing it from existing PoS models.

- If a validator commits misconduct, their **staked ETH is confiscated**.
- The addition of a penalty (Slashing) feature to enhance security in PoS is a key characteristic.

### **🔹 Two versions of Casper**

1️⃣ **Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget)**

- A **hybrid approach** that combines PoW with PoS
- Aims for a stable transition by mixing PoW blocks and PoS blocks

2️⃣ **Casper CBC (Correct-by-Construction)**

- A complete PoS method
- All blocks are verified and finalized by voters
  📌 **Analogy:**
  > Casper is similar to a **“bank deposit + penalty system.”**
  >
  > If you are honest, you receive interest, but if you commit fraud, your deposit (staked ETH) is confiscated.

## **📌 6️⃣ PoW vs PoS Comparison**

| **Comparison Items**    | **PoW (Proof of Work)**        | **PoS (Proof of Stake)**     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Solving computational problems | Staking coins (staking)      |
| **Reward mechanism**    | Mining rewards                 | Validator rewards            |
| **Energy consumption**  | High                           | Low                          |
| **Security**            | ASIC monopoly possible         | Validator slashing (penalty) |
| **Scalability**         | Low                            | High                         |

📌 **Analogy:**

> PoW is a “reward system where those who work harder receive more rewards.”
>
> PoS is a “reward system where those who save more receive more rewards.”
